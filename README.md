# R5-Reloaded-Weapon-Maker

A simple project made by justanotheruser. Focus on quick designing of weapons and makes it as easy as possible. 
Ensure that you have selected your game folder via the settings.




This was just a quick simple project so don't be suprised if this version is unstable.




If you have any errors you most likely don't have path on Python, or your install is shit. I would recommend watching a youtube guide on it so here's one that worked for me.
Also if you have any errors first delete python and redownload it.
